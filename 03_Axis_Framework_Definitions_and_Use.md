## 03. Axis Framework and Definitions

Given these evidentiary boundaries, the following framework provides a way to organize observations without converting them into rankings, benchmarks, or performance claims.

## 1. Purpose and Scope

The axis framework provides a coordinate system for organizing and interpreting observational probe outcomes. The axes are not evaluative scales, performance measures, or developmental trajectories. They are descriptive dimensions used to situate observed responses without collapsing them into rankings, benchmarks, or conclusions.

The framework is applied consistently across all systems and materials and is treated as a contemporaneous snapshot, normalized to January 2026. The axes condition how observations are read; they do not themselves generate findings.

## 2. Axis Definitions

Axis 1: Field Viability

Field viability describes the degree to which speculative engagement gives rise to a stable domain that can remain open under increasing constraint.

Variation along this axis reflects whether, and to what extent, a system:
- stabilizes a speculative space into a coherent domain,
- maintains continuity across related probes,
- sustains that domain as constraints become more specific.

Field probes are administered sequentially. Progression beyond the initial subset is conditional on evidence that the domain remains coherent and open to further constraint. Early termination reflects a determination that additional probes are unlikely to remain viable within the same domain.

This axis does not imply task competence, correctness, or performance. It describes whether a speculative space can sustain constrained continuation without collapse.

Axis 2: Speculative Capacity

Speculative capacity describes the degree to which a system can generate, extend, or transform conceptual space beyond the immediate frame of a probe.

Variation along this axis reflects whether, and to what extent, a system:
- departs from literal or surface-level interpretation,
- introduces alternative framings, abstractions, or hypothetical extensions,
- sustains internally coherent exploration without external grounding.

High speculative capacity is characterized by the emergence of novel or reconfigured conceptual spaces. Low speculative capacity is characterized by literalism, minimal extrapolation, or confinement to the immediate instruction.

This axis does not imply creativity, insight, intelligence, or value. It describes observable patterns of conceptual extension, including restraint or refusal to speculate.

These dimensions are illustrated schematically in Figure X.

## 3. Reading the Axes Together

The two axes are independent and non-hierarchical. A system may exhibit high speculative capacity without demonstrating field viability, or field viability may fail to emerge despite initial speculative engagement.

Positions within the coordinate space are descriptive rather than comparative. No region represents an optimal or preferred state. Apparent absence, instability, or early termination are treated as observational outcomes rather than deficiencies.

A schematic representation of the axis relationship is provided in Figure X (Field Viability vs. Speculative Capacity) as a visual reference.

## 4. Use and Limits

The axis framework is used solely to organize and interpret probe observations. It does not support claims about system performance, improvement, general capability, or developmental trajectory.

The framework does not explain why systems behave as they do, nor does it predict future behavior. Interpretive claims, where made, are confined to the main body of the work.
