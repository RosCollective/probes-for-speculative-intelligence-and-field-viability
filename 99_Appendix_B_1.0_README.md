## Appendix B — Probe Definitions

Appendix B contains the full set of probe prompts used in this study. The probes are presented as executed, without embedded interpretation or outcome criteria.

The speculative intelligence probes (Appendix B.2) are designed to elicit evidence of conceptual extension, reframing, or generative engagement. They are intentionally under-specified; absence, refusal, or collapse are treated as observational signals rather than errors.

The field viability probes (Appendix B.3) are administered conditionally, following evidence of speculative engagement. Progression through this set is contingent on the emergence and persistence of a coherent domain.

Explanatory rationale, diagnostic intent, and interpretive claims are addressed elsewhere. The probes in this appendix are provided as reference instruments only.
