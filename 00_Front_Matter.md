## Abstract

This document presents a structured set of qualitative probes used to examine
speculative intelligence and field viability across contemporary AI systems.
Rather than offering performance evaluation, benchmarking, or ranking, the work
introduces an observational framework intended to surface structural alignment,
comparative tendencies, and recurring failure modes.

Systems are positioned based on qualitative comparative judgment informed by
repeated probe application. Figures and supporting artifacts are intended to
illustrate relative relationships and tendencies, not to assert claims of
capability, agency, or intelligence.

## How to Read This Document

This document is intended to be read sequentially. Sections 1–4 establish
orientation, evidentiary boundaries, axis definitions, and observational
synthesis. Appendices provide the complete probe sets and raw observational
artifacts referenced in the main text.

Figures illustrate relative relationships only. Spatial proximity should not be
interpreted as quantitative measurement or performance ranking.
