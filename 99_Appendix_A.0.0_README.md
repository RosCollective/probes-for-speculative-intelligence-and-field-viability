# Appendix A — Probe Execution and Outcome Tables

This directory contains the full set of tabular materials supporting the analysis presented in *Probes for Speculative Intelligence*.

Appendix A is provided for transparency and auditability. The spreadsheets collected here constitute the operational substrate from which the paper’s qualitative findings are derived. They are not intended to function as benchmarks, rankings, or performance comparisons.

## Scope and Temporal Normalization

All probe executions and resulting materials are treated as contemporaneous and are normalized to **January 2026** for purposes of analysis and presentation. No analytical distinctions are drawn from sub-month timing or execution order.

## File Organization

Files are ordered to reflect methodological dependency and interpretive precedence:

### Appendix A.1 — Probe Definitions and Evaluation Frame
- Canonical definitions of probes, capacities, and outcome categories.
- Serves as the semantic and structural reference for all subsequent tables.

### Appendix A.2 — System Probe Outcome Tables
- Individual probe outcome tables for peer systems.
- Systems are ordered alphabetically.
- Tables document observed responses and classified outcomes only; no aggregate scoring or ranking is performed.

### Appendix A.3 — Reference System (ROS) Trials
- Probe outcomes for the Reference Operating System (ROS).
- Included as methodological reference material.
- ROS trials are not treated as peer systems and are not directly compared to other systems.

### Appendix A.4 — Excluded Systems
- Systems considered but excluded from analysis, with brief rationale.
- Included to clarify methodological boundaries and selection criteria.

## Interpretive Notes

- The tables in this appendix are evidentiary, not explanatory.
- Absence of a capacity or outcome should not be read as system deficiency.
- Inclusion does not imply endorsement, optimization, or completeness.
- No claims about system evolution, improvement, or degradation over time are made.
