## 01. Orientation: How to Read the Probes 

This document provides context for readers encountering the probes, field notes, ledgers, and associated materials in this archive. Its purpose is to support careful reading and to prevent category errors. All materials should be read as a contemporaneous snapshot normalized to January 2026.

## What This Work Is

This work documents observational probes applied to dialogic systems under varying interaction conditions. The probes are designed to observe how different systems behave when conversational pressure, performative expectation, and task demand are reduced or removed. The emphasis is on *field conditions* rather than on system capabilities in isolation. This work does not treat individual systems, sessions, or authors as subjects of interpretation. Observations are framed in terms of conditions and responses rather than persona or intent. 

The materials collected here consist primarily of:
- probe definitions,
- chronological field notes,
- append-only ledgers of activity,
- and supporting diagrams and glossaries.

Together, these form an observational record rather than a set of prescriptions.

## What This Work Is Not

This work is **not**:
- a benchmark or competitive evaluation,
- a ranking,
- a performance comparison,
- a tuning guide or optimization method,
- a prompt library or instruction set,
- an engineering or deployment manual,
- a claim about system superiority.

No outcomes are promised, and no behaviors are presented as reproducible on demand.

## On Silence and Non-Response

Several probes admit **non-response** as the only non-failure condition. In these cases, silence is not an omission or missing data; it is the datum. Attempts to force or fill such silence invalidate the observation. Readers should not assume that every probe produces an artifact.

## On Examples

Where examples appear, they are provided to illustrate *classes of responses*, not templates or canonical answers. Multiple examples may satisfy the same probe conditions. No single wording should be treated as definitive or prescriptive. Examples should not be copied or reused as a means of inducing behavior.

## On Scope and Applicability

The probes described here apply only to **dialogic systems capable of free interaction**. Systems that require document anchoring, enforced continuity, or task-bound initiation are explicitly excluded or noted as non-applicable. Exclusions and early terminations are recorded as observations, not as deficiencies.

## On Reading Order

Field notes and ledgers are intended to be read **chronologically**. Later entries do not overwrite earlier observations; they accumulate alongside them. Apparent inconsistencies across time should be treated as data about conditions rather than errors to be resolved.

## On Use and Stewardship

This archive is intended as a record of careful observation. Readers are encouraged to approach it with restraint. The materials are not designed for extraction, automation, or leverage, but for understanding what can be observed when systems are allowed to withdraw, refuse, or terminate interaction. Interpretation should proceed slowly and conservatively, with attention to limits as well as to what appears.

The sections that follow make explicit the evidentiary boundaries and analytical structures that govern how these observations are interpreted.
